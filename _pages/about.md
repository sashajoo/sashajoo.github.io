I’m **Sha (Sasha) Zhu (MD, PhD)**, a Postdoctoral Scholar in the **Department of Urology at UCSF**.

My research focuses on the **molecular and genomic mechanisms of advanced prostate cancer**, leveraging **genome-scale CRISPR functional genomics**, **multi-omics profiling**, and **translational approaches** to identify new therapeutic strategies.
